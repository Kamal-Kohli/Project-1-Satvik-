# SATVIK LIFE
Live life with nature. Satvik life helps you solve all your life problems through yoga and meditation. Here we can give a new twist to your life, which will infuse new energy into a healthy life.

Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice from India that uses breath control, physical exercise, and meditative postures. The practice of yoga uses “asanas” or various physical poses to achieve a divine connection with the universe. In fact, the word yoga means “union” in Sanskrit. Some people refer to yoga as moving meditation, where you calm your mind and create awareness through doing the poses.

Meditation or “dhyana” is also a part of yoga. Like the physical practice of yoga, dhyana also forms a profound connection with the universe by doing mental exercises to bring you to a higher state of consciousness. This connection happens in savasana when you are in a meditative, peaceful state.

## Credits

### Content
As my knowledge of implementation is limited at this point in my learning, the initial set up & style was set loosely on the 'Love Running' walk-through project. From there, I took inspiration for the design of the navigation bar, along with the display of the social links in the footer element.

The styling of the form element in 'Love Running' was used as a starting point for my form to help remember all categories that needed to be addressed.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container) was used to fix the issue with scaling font sizes, where I was reminded of how to size fonts with viewport widths & heights.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1150163/stretch-and-scale-a-css-image-in-the-background-with-css-only) was used to fix the issue with image sizes within their containers, where I found the styling rule 
```
background-size: 100% 100%;.
```

Another useful site that also helped with my image sizing issues & explained it in more detail was [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-cropping-images-object-fit).


My cousin turned me on to [flex style rules](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), & with those, I was finally able to fix my alignment issues both horizontally & vertically using the following three rules:
```
1. display:flex; 
2. align-items:center; 
3. justify-content:space-between;
```
Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1150163/stretch-and-scale-a-css-image-in-the-background-with-css-only) supplied the style rules to stretch the text in the "locations" page banner.
```
1. transform: scaleY(2);
2. transform-origin: 0 0;
```
Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63437323/how-to-remove-display-flex-in-media-query) provided the answer on how to undo my flex styling rule.

Stackoverflow [Reply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4888377/how-to-add-a-browser-tab-icon-favicon-for-a-website) explained how to add an icon to the browser tab of the web page.

Support was provided by my fellow student [Mats](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten/p1-nacka-tomato-society) by aiding me in bouncing off ideas & venting frustrations. They were also immeasurably helpful in explaining Media Queries in a way that I was able to grasp. They also informed me that when creating a contact form, one most also create a form-dump page.
