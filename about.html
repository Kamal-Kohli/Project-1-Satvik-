                <h2>Why Yoga Vidya School(Satvik Life)?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The above Shloka explains the true meaning of ‘Vidya,’ a Sanskrit word for Knowledge. The knowledge
                    of Yoga gives inner peace and liberty and thats what inspired us to create Yoga Vidya School – the
                    place of peace and liberty with meaningful practice of Yoga.

                    Yoga Vidya School is the traditional Yoga And Vedanta school based in Rishikesh, follows two Yogic
                    traditions:

                    Swami Satyananda Saraswati (Bihar School of Yoga)
                    T Krishnamacharya and K Pattabhi Jois (Ashtanga Vinyasa)
                    The theoretical subjects are inspired and based on Vedantic philosophy by Shankaracharya Vedanta, in
                    addition, we cover philosophies of Bhagavad Gita, Patanjali Yoga Sutra, Hatha Pradipika, Upanishads,
                    etc.

                    Our yoga training modules let the students gain the practical and philosophical knowledge of Hatha
                    Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa both.
